# Autism-Detection-and-Emotion-Recognition-A-Data-Driven-Approach
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts communication, behavior, and social interaction, making early diagnosis and emotional understanding critical. This project developed a machine learning system for autism detection and emotion recognition using SENet and transfer learning models. By integrating multimodal datasets, the system aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide valuable insights into emotional patterns of individuals with ASD.
